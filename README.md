jquery-matrix-digital-rain
==========================

As the name suggests, this is a script to create a matrix-like digital rain animation.
Contrary to the name, since near its inception, this project does not actually use jQuery.

Originally based on Digital Rain jQuery plugin by James Seibel: http://www.jqueryrain.com/2011/05/jquery-digital-rain/
The original file listed above has been included as: digitalRain.js
Since this project was started, however, most of the original code has been completely rewritten or replaced.
This includes the removal of jQuery, completely different character sets, UI structure, and so on.

The end result is matrix.js, or matrix.min.js for direct use in a page.
The underlying javascript has been modified heavily to dramatically increase performance, reduce the script size, and reduce overhead.
Extremely basic HTML and CSS files have been included to provide an example page using this animation.
Vital CSS and HTML has been included in the matrix.js file.
