jquery-matrix-digital-rain
==========================

As the name suggests, this is a script to create a matrix-like digital rain animation.

Based on Digital Rain jQuery plugin by James Seibel: http://www.jqueryrain.com/2011/05/jquery-digital-rain/
The original file listed above has been included as: digitalRain.js

My modified version has been named: matrix.js
The underlying javascript has been modified to dramatically increase performance and reduce overhead.
Basic HTML and CSS files have been included to provide an example page using this animation.
